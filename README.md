PROJECT IDEA

Create a short choose-your-own-adventure as a proof of concept for a larger project.

The design and story will be heavily themed around the material and world created for the tabletop roleplaying game, Mork Borg*. Mork Borg has a bold visual style that I love and would like to emulate. 

I have already created a pamphlet adventure for Mork Borg and relaased it via Kickstarter. I considered translating that adventure for this project but the content might be a little graphic. More information on it can be found here (only suitable for 18+) - ***Link to Oyster Ditch

***include links to Johan Nohr's design manifesto.

THIRD PARTY LICENCE
Mork Borg has a third-party licence. It allows creators to make money from any products they create from it. Creators have to include specific information somewhere on their project. The licence allows creators to use aspects of the Mork Borg rulebook such as mechanics, place names, and some creatures.

For more information on the Mork Borg third-party licence, see here - <https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjerNqr7PyBAxVaW0EAHerpBUIQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fliberludorum.com%2F2021%2F07%2F05%2Fthe-mork-borg-third-party-license-you%2F&usg=AOvVaw3YTWA8FG2jswu0qQE8RIYG&opi=89978449>

Scope

As I'm not being judged on my creative writing, the goal of the project will be to construct just enough narrative to tie together scenes that demonstrate the core mechanics. These are listed in order of importance. I aim to include as many of these as I can.
